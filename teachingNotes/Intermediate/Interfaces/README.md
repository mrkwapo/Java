#Interfaces

We use interfaces to build loosely-coupled, extensible, and testable applications

* It is good practice to code our classes to work with interfaces and not concrete implementations

* Interfaces suggest what should be done while Classes define how it should be done.

Examples of Interfaces:
  * Data compression
  * Encrypting
  * Sorting
  * Searching
